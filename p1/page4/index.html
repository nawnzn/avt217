<p>And indeed there will be time<br />
To wonder, “Do I dare?” and, “Do I dare?”<br />
Time to turn back and descend the stair,<br />
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair —<br />
(They will say: “How his hair is growing thin!”)<br />
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,<br />
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin —<br />
(They will say: “But how his arms and legs are thin!”)<br />
Do I dare<br />
Disturb the universe?<br />
In a minute there is time<br />
For <a href="../page5/index.html">decisions and revisions</a>which a minute will reverse.</p>
