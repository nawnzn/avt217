<p>No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;<br />
Am an attendant lord, one that will do<br />
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,<br />
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,<br />
Deferential, glad to be of use,<br />
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;<br />
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;<br />
At times, indeed, almost ridiculousâ€”<br />
Almost, at times, the Fool.<br />

<p>I grow old ... I grow old ...<br />
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.<br /></p>

<p>Shall I part my hair behind?<br />
Do I dare to eat a peach?<br />
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.<br />
I have heard the mermaids <a href="../page10/index.html">singing,</a> each to each.</p>
