<p>I do not think that they will sing to me.<br /></p>

<p>I have seen them riding seaward on the waves<br />
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back<br />
When the wind blows the water white and black.<br />
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea<br />
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown<br />
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.</p>
