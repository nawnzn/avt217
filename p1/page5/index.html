<p>For I have known them all already, known them all:<br />
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,<br />
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;<br />
I know the voices dying with a dying fall<br />
Beneath the music from a farther room.<br />
	<p>So how should I presume?</p></p>

<p>And I have known the eyes already, known them all—<br />
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,<br />
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,<br />
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,<br />
Then how should I begin<br />
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?<br />
	<p>And how should I presume?<br /></p></p>

<p>And I have known the arms already, known them all—<br />
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare<br />
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)<br />
Is it perfume from a dress<br />
That makes me so digress?<br />
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.<br />
<p>And should I then presume?<br /></p>
