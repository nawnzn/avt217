<p>And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!<br />
Smoothed by long fingers,<br />
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,<br />
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.<br />
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,<br />
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?<br />
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,<br />
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,<br />
I am no prophet — and here’s no great matter;<br />
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,<br />
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,<br />
And in short,<a href="../page8/index.html">I was afraid.</a></p>
