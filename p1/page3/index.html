<p>The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,<br />
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,<br />
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,<br />
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,<br />
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,<br />
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,<br />
And seeing that it was a soft October night,<br />
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.<br /></p>

<p>And indeed there will be time<br />
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,<br />
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;<br />
There will be time, there will be time<br />
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;<br />
There will be time to murder and create,<br />
And time for all the works and days of hands<br />
That lift and drop a question on your plate;<br />
Time for you and time for me,<br />
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,<br />
And for a hundred visions and revisions,<br />
Before the taking of a toast and tea.<br />
