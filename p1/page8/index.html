<p>And would it have been worth it, after all,<br />
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,<br />
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,<br />
Would it have been worth while,<br />
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,<br />
To have squeezed the universe into a ball<br />
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,<br />
To say: “I am Lazarus, come from the dead,<br />
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all”—<br />
If one, settling a pillow by her head<br />
<p>Should say: “That is not what I meant at all;<br />
That is not it, at all.”</p>

<p>And would it have been worth it, after all,<br />
Would it have been worth while,<br />
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,<br />
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor—<br />
And this, and so much more?—<br />
It is impossible to say just what I mean!<br />
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:<br />
Would it have been worth while<br />
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,<br />
And turning toward the window, should say:<br />
<p>“That is not it at all,<br />
<p>That is not what I meant, at<a href="../page9/index.html"> all.</a>"</p>
